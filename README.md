## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- TailwindCSS


### What I learned

I understood CSS sizing in Tailwind using h-[value] & w-[value].

It was fun to play around with different values to achieve the desired sizing for my divs.

Some examples:

```html
<div class="qr-code w-11/12 mt-4 ">
</div>
```
This was the code I implemented for the QR code image, I wanted the QR code to take up atleast 80-90% of the div so that it leaves a little space on each side.
